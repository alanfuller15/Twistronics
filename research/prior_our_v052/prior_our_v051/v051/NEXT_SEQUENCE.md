# Next bounded batch after our v051

Completed locally: the extra flat-pair birth and annihilation, both engines at N4/N6, with a joined A=0.2,B=0 station. The upper-pair preparation birth was completed in v050. Do not redo those event-location passes.

1. **Preparation lower-pair birth.** At A=0.2,B=−0.25,T=0,phi=0,ratio=0.8, use both lower-gap seeds from the retained v048 lower-inventory probe (gap index 2 in the eight-band harness):
   - BM linear: (0.6570477101,0.6394959048), (0.6989918503,0.5857819107).
   - TBG exact: (0.6570495772,0.6394933674), (0.6989902174,0.5857834376).
   Follow backward toward B=−0.10 to establish a bracket. Search failures and duplicate roots are not birth locations. Inspect the lower-gap inventory before deciding whether a full-chart opening or a separately frozen local-domain gate is appropriate. Preserve the historical geometry/cutoff tolerances.
2. **Original flat-pair preparation.** Track from A=B=T=0,phi=0,ratio=0.8 through A=0.2, then B=−0.25. Include parameter-frame transport/refinement and explicitly join roots and relative orientation into v044. The outside-domain root controls in v051 establish local persistence only, not that complete frame replay. Contacts in neighboring gaps also limit any global Euler-class interpretation.
3. **Separate lower unlink collision.** Start from the last retained accepted lower-root inventory on the v044 B leg. Identify the subsequent event bracket rather than assuming the earlier sampled flat-pair T leg measured it.

Keep at most two single-thread numerical workers, N4 qualification before N6, bounded event windows, source-hashed protocols and atomic checkpoints. Deliver one ZIP with raw results, explicit remaining coverage and the team-share note.
