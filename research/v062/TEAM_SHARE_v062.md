# TEAM SHARE — our v062

The N8 braid-2 U-pair continuation now reaches ratio 1.00000 in both lab_nn_full engines. This batch starts from the retained v060 ratio=.99100 roots and temporal/coarse frames. It measures the join again and carries both individual node orientations through ten new states per engine. Combined with retained v060, the sampled braid-2 chain spans .99000–1.00000 at fifteen distinct ratios per engine. The earlier crossing calculation remains the v060 measurement; it was not rerun here.

Each engine preserves its inherited temporal charges: BM **[1, 1]**, reference **[-1, -1]**. Those absolute signs depend on the initial gauge. The directly transported spatial comparison is a separate observable. Cross-engine spatial label agreement: **True**.

The repeated join moved roots by at most **1.7666244e-14** in fractional reciprocal coordinates and aligned temporal frame entries by at most **2.22044605e-16**. Raw node subspaces were checked against both predecessor temporal and coarse frames. Saved frames also pass orthonormality, temporal polar-alignment, orientation and coarse/fine checks. The unwrapped chart remains [0,1] × [0,1.1]; U2 is not silently wrapped below f2=1.

Fresh evidence: **22 measured states**, including two repeated joins and **20 new states**, **132 refined roots**, **10 coarse/fine parameter-frame comparisons**, **22 frame checkpoints** and **66 mesh/radius trial sets**. Each trial set includes both temporal charges and the spatial B charge. The first parameter comparison uses .0005 fine/.001 coarse spacing; the remaining four per engine use .001 fine/.002 coarse, including the 1.000 endpoint. Spatial transport uses 128/256 base steps, adjacent-node seeds and refinement of sampled interior minima in both exterior gaps. Minimum sampled/located comparison gap: **0.0227667126 meV**; minimum spatial overlap: **0.985645988**. Phase-only retry stages used: **0**.

All six named roots are compared at the ten common retained ratios .991 through 1.000. The .9915 checkpoint is new sampling. Maximum BM/reference endpoint-root displacement: **2.03092293e-05**. This reflects the declared model conventions; no cross-engine coordinate equality was forced.

Held state: A=0, B=−.4, T=−.8, phi=80°, theta=1.05°, eps=.003, w_kappa=0 and w_mode=average. The model keeps w1=110 meV and w0=110 times the varied ratio. BM uses linear reciprocal geometry/cutoff_tol=1e-6; reference uses exact reciprocal geometry/cutoff_tol=1e-9. Dimension is 1060 in both engines. All earlier v061 diagnostic/recovery evidence and failures remain unchanged.

Runtime records are stable within each new run. The predecessor used the invocation name `python`; this batch used `python3`. Reconciliation verifies that both names resolve to the same executable and SHA-256, and that every other recorded runtime field matches. The original records retain both names; this is not claimed as literal record equality.

Publication uses **84 actual assertion passes** from complete-suite run `20260921T044932Z_e7384068`, bound to code, tests, inputs, results and runtime. The numerical plan was frozen before workers; the publication plan was frozen after measurements and before this test run. All **3274** prior tracked files are preserved, with the previous README retained in provenance. The ZIP contains the complete research, audit and team history.

The coverage ledger (`COVERAGE.md` / `COVERAGE.json`) maps retained N4/N6 campaign families to the specific N8 work now available. The next bounded workflow is the first cleanup connection after braid 2, starting at this ratio=1.000 checkpoint, under a separately frozen budget and inherited frame/seed joins. Completing this ratio leg does not complete the N8 campaign.

Limits:

- Eleven measured states per engine include one repeated join and ten new states. Combined with v060, the finite sampled braid-2 chain spans .99000 to 1.00000, with fifteen distinct ratios per engine; this is not continuous-interval proof.
- The spatial charge comparison and each temporally carried individual charge are different observables. Absolute temporal signs depend on each engine's inherited gauge and are not compared across engines.
- Retained v042 accepted results; held-state linkage is contextual through replay_second.py -> models.State, not embedded in the old raw records. N4/N6 are not freshly executed in v060. N4/N6 likewise were not rerun in v062.
- Two engines share this measurement harness and the constant-tunnelling lab_nn_full approximation. BM linear and reference exact reciprocal geometry remain distinct.
- Saved frame reconciliation checks hashes, orthogonality, joins and polar alignment; it does not independently rerun all eigenproblems or winding loops. Sampled/located gap minima are not global gap bounds.
- This extends only the U-pair braid-2 frame path. Remaining connecting legs, full flat-pair/Euler/endpoint-w1 coverage at N8, infinite-cutoff accuracy, a microscopic tunnelling strain law and physical validation remain open.
- Preserved v061 recovery and prior failure history remain unchanged. Source/test/result hashes establish internal consistency, not independent authenticity, chronology or scientific truth.
