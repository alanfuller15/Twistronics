# v054 follow-up to the inspection-only audit

The original audit and v053 source/evidence remain unchanged. Repairs and fresh measurements live in [research/v054](../../research/v054/README.md).

| Finding | New-version disposition | Evidence and remaining scope |
|---|---|---|
| F01 | Final optimizer metadata, attempt history and explicit nonfinite/failure handling repaired. | Regression tests cover differing attempt outcomes. All 76 fresh preparation states complete with BM.refine forbidden; older actual consumers remain unreviewed. |
| F02 | Publication requires matching complete-suite evidence. | 61 passing tests in run `20260921T001901Z_99cfc67a`; source, test, input and runtime binding, JUnit and call/collection records. Historical v053 prose remains historical. |
| F03 | Explicit preserved-tree provenance contract replaces the absent-prior-ZIP dependency for v054. | Original manifest members are verified; output parents are created; no original ZIP byte stream is reconstructed or claimed. |
| F04/F05 | Runtime reality/Hermiticity guards and exploratory-only legacy entry points. | Tests exercise ordinary Python and `-O`; active accepted preparation replay uses its existing independent gates. Legacy numerical routines are not promoted to certification interfaces. |

Fresh impact result: 76/76 states and all four engine/cutoff cases reproduce, with zero spatial-label changes, zero root/gap differences at recorded precision and minimum old/new frame-plane overlap 0.9999999999999978. Eleven forbidden legacy surfaces record zero calls in each case. This establishes observed non-use and result agreement on the preparation route only. It does not establish non-impact across every historical result.

Read [REPORT.md](../../research/v054/REPORT.md), [IMPACT.json](../../research/v054/IMPACT.json), and [SOURCE_REVIEW.md](../../research/v054/SOURCE_REVIEW.md). The separate lower unlink collision and the scientific/security limits from the audit remain open. The newer report's test count is derived from bound evidence; this note quotes that specific recorded run.
